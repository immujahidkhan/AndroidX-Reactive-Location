AndroidX-Reactive-Location

ReactiveLocation library for Android
====================================

Small library that wraps Google Play Services API in brilliant [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
```Observables``` reducing boilerplate to minimum.

Current stable version - 2.1
---------------

**This version works with Google Play Services 11+ and RxJava 2.+**

Artifact name: ```android-reactive-location2```

RxJava1 stable version - 1.0
--------------
**RxJava1 version:**

Artifact name: ```android-reactive-location```

What can you do with that?
--------------------------

* easily connect to Play Services API
* obtain last known location
* subscribe for location updates
* use location settings API
* manage geofences
* geocode location to list of addresses
* activity recognition
* use current place API
* fetch place autocomplete suggestions

How does the API look like?
----------------------------

Simple. All you need is to create ```ReactiveLocationProvider``` using your context.
All observables are already there. Examples are worth more than 1000 words:


### Getting last known location

```java
ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
locationProvider.getLastKnownLocation()
    .subscribe(new Consumer<Location>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Location location) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
        }
    });
```

Yep, Java 8 is not there yet (and on Android it will take a while) but there is
absolutely no Google Play Services LocationClient callbacks hell and there is no
clean-up you have to do.

### Subscribing for location updates

```java
LocationRequest request = LocationRequest.create() //standard GMS LocationRequest
                                  .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                                  .setNumUpdates(5)
                                  .setInterval(100);

ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
Subscription subscription = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(request)
    .filter(...)    // you can filter location updates
    .map(...)       // you can map location to sth different
    .flatMap(...)   // or event flat map
    ...             // and do everything else that is provided by RxJava
    .subscribe(new Consumer<Location>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Location location) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
        }
    });
```

When you are done (for example in ```onStop()```) remember to unsubscribe.

```java
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

### Subscribing for Activity Recognition

Getting activity recognition is just as simple

```java

ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
Subscription subscription = locationProvider.getDetectedActivity(0) // detectionIntervalMillis
    .filter(...)    // you can filter location updates
    .map(...)       // you can map location to sth different
    .flatMap(...)   // or event flat map
    ...             // and do everything else that is provided by RxJava
    .subscribe(new Consumer<ActivityRecognitionResult>() {
        @Override
        public void call(ActivityRecognitionResult detectedActivity) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedActivity(detectedActivity);
        }
    });
```

### Reverse geocode location

Do you need address for location?

```java
Observable<List<Address>> reverseGeocodeObservable = locationProvider
    .getReverseGeocodeObservable(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), MAX_ADDRESSES);

reverseGeocodeObservable
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())               // use I/O thread to query for addresses
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())  // return result in main android thread to manipulate UI
    .subscribe(...);
```

### Geocode location

Do you need address for a text search query?

```java
Observable<List<Address>> geocodeObservable = locationProvider
    .getGeocodeObservable(String userQuery, MAX_ADDRESSES);

geocodeObservable
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(...);
```

### Managing geofences

For geofence management use `addGeofences` and `removeGeofences` methods.

### Checking location settings though location settings API

To get ```LocationSettingsResponse``` for your ```LocationRequest``` check
out ```ReactiveLocationProvider.checkLocationSettings()``` method. Sample
usage can be found in **sample** project in ```MainActivity``` class.

### Connecting to Google Play Services API

If you just need managed connection to Play Services API
use ```ReactiveLocationProvider.getGoogleApiClientObservable()```.
On subscription it will connect to the API.
Unsubscription will close the connection.

### Creating observable from PendingResult

If you are manually using Google Play Services and you are dealing with
```PendingResult``` you can easily transform them to observables with
```ReactiveLocationProvider.fromPendingResult()``` method.

### Transforming buffers to observable

To transform any buffer to observable and autorelease it on unsubscription
use ```DataBufferObservable.from()``` method. It will let you easily flatMap
such data as ```PlaceLikelihoodBuffer``` or ```AutocompletePredictionBuffer```
from Places API. For usage example see ```PlacesActivity``` sample.

### Places API

You can fetch current place or place suggestions using:

* ```ReactiveLocationProvider.getCurrentPlace()```
* ```ReactiveLocationProvider.getPlaceAutocompletePredictions()```
* ```ReactiveLocationProvider.getPlaceById()```

For more info see sample project and ```PlacesActivity```.

### Cooler examples

Do you need location with certain accuracy but don't want to wait for it more than 4 sec? No problem.

```java
LocationRequest req = LocationRequest.create()
                         .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                         .setExpirationDuration(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS))
                         .setInterval(LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL);

Observable<Location> goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(req)
            .filter(new Func1<Location, Boolean>() {
                @Override
                public Boolean call(Location location) {
                    return location.getAccuracy() < SUFFICIENT_ACCURACY;
                }
            })
            .timeout(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Observable.just((Location) null), AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .first()
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());

goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable.subscribe(...);
```


How to use it?
--------------

Library is available in maven central.

### Gradle

Just use it as dependency in your *build.gradle* file
along with Google Play Services and RxJava.

It may be necessary to add google play services and rxanroid dependency as well.

```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

```
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.immujahidkhan:AndroidX-Reactive-Location:0.1'
	}
```
